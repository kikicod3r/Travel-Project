            <h3>Kuala Lumpur, the Garden City of Lights</h3>
            <p>
              Kuala Lumpur, or KL was initially a tin mining settlement in the
              1880's and has since grown into a modern hub with a population
              just over 8.5 million people.
            </p>
            <p>
              The city is known to boast beautiful patches of greenery, gardens,
              and parks along with stylish skyscrapers which is why it is known
              as the Garden City of Lights. There is an abundance of culture
              with large portions of the population originating from China and
              India, and of course the native Malay. Because of this, you will
              find delicious food, street markets, and rich architecture.

            <p>
              Hi there! My name is Markita. I created this site to showcase the
              beauty and culture of one of my favorite cities in the world,
              Kuala Lumpur. I was lucky enough to visit Malaysia for a wedding
              in 2020 and have not stopped thinking about this wonderful country
              since! I hope the information on this site will help the planning
              process for anyone thinking about traveling to the area.
