            <h2>Why Kuala Lumpur?</h2>
            <h3>Kuala Lumpur: The Garden City of Lights</h3>
            <p>
              Kuala Lumpur, or KL was initially a tin mining settlement in the
              1880's and has since grown into a modern hub with a population
              just over 8.5 million people.
            </p>
            <p>
              The city is known to boast beautiful patches of greenery, gardens,
              and parks along with stylish skyscrapers which is why it is known
              as the Garden City of Lights. There is an abundance of culture
              with large portions of the population originating from China and
              India, and of course the native Malay. Because of this, you will
              find delicious food, street markets, and rich architecture.

                <p>
                  The Batu Caves are said to be over 400 million years old. Yes,
                  million! A historic stop for anyone wanting to see and learn
                  more about Hindu culture. If you can make it up the 272
                  brightly colored steps, you are able to walk farther into the
                  actual caves. Just beware of the rowdy long tailed Macaques
                  monkeys. They are very used to human interaction and will
                  swipe for your bag or water bottle if left unattended. The
                  views from this area are breathtaking, be sure to see for
                  yourself!

                <p>
                  These towers are 88 stories tall. Visitors will take an
                  elevator up 170 meters to the sky bridge which connects the
                  two towers. The sky bridge is currently the world's highest
                  two-story bridge. Next, you are taken to the 86th floor where
                  you will have the best views of the entire city, spanning to
                  the countryside. I was able to tour during the day, but the
                  towers are just as astonishing at night. We went to the towers
                  one night and they shine bright white light along with
                  wonderful colored lights from the fountain out front.

                <p>
                  This market has hundreds of vendors offering a wide variety of
                  options, the most important being tons of food! I would
                  suggest coming with an empty stomach so you can try as many
                  foods as possible, and of course save room for dessert! The
                  market is located in Chinatown and is accessible through
                  multiple public transportation options. Vendors range from
                  clothing and accessorties to fabrics, souveniers and much
                  more.

              since! I hope the information on this site will help the planning
              process for anyone thinking about traveling to the area.
